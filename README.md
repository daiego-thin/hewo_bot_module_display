# Display Module
`hewo_bot_module_display` opens up a pygame window. Pygame is really useful in this case since we need to spin the node for
each frame or game tick.

This window will open in full size with HeWo's Face, and all of it's features being published.

## Standalone Usage
In this first version, you can simply run HeWo as a videogame and test out it's face features 
in order to create emotions and expressions.

### Face only
Go to:
```bash
cd hewo_bot_module_display
python3 main.py
```

### Face controls
This is still a work in progress feature, but you can control HeWo's face with the following keys:
```bash
cd hewo_bot_module_display
python3 test.py
```
This part wont be necesary in the future, when we hold the implementation of the web monitor.
